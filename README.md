# Java-Typing-Application
Typing Application:
The application will display a keyboard on the screen. When the user hits any of the keys on the physical keyboard, it should also highlight the corresponding button that they just typed. On the virtual keyboard, it will stay highlighted until the user hits a different key. Clicking the buttons themselves with the mouse does nothing. The buttons are just there to provide a visual for the user while he/she types.
